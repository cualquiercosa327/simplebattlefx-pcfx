SIMPLE BATTLE FX 
=====================

SIMPLE BATTLE FX is a very simple and primitive turn-by-turn rpg where your goal is to defeat your opponent.

This homebrew game should work on a retail NEC PC-FX.
If it does not,  create an issue.

The first public non-playable NEC PC-FX game was a demo of Frog Feast
and the first playable homebrew released to the public is Soviet Union 210.

Many thanks to trap15 for Liberis !

Now all i gotta do is to wait for elmer to improve liberis.
